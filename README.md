# Steam-sample-dataset-anlysis-

  An analysis project done on dataset downloaded from kaggle, it contains a data on a sample of players and games and the hrs played by the players on each game. this project was done using mysql, tableau public and excel. With the metrics provided in the dataset indepth analytics could not be performed but the analysis is in the png file, it also contains the dashboard which i created with tableau.
   
   There are 5155 different games in the dataset and 12939 different player id's.
   
   Dota 2, Team fortress 2 are the top 2 games with the most purchases and the difference between the purchases of the game isnt much appart from the first few games.
   
   The highest amount of purchases made by 1 player was 1075 and the highest average time spent playing all the games combined is 11754hrs 
   
   I do not know the time frame for the recorded data because it was not specified.
   
   I also uploaded the original csv file (steam-200k) and some csv files which i created to perform the analysis.
